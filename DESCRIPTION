Description: R-best matching is a new graded matching strategy in which potential pairings are graded, 
    with a preference for higher grade pairings. An r-best match tries to match with pairs of the best 
    grade, incorporating progressively lower grade pairs only to the degree they are needed, and only 
    needs to use edges in the r best grades. In effect, only sparse networks are built, stored and 
    optimized.
